## Download SSMS
To set up SSMS on a Windows system, download the installer from the link below:

[**Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 20.2**](*)

SSMS 20.2 is the most recent general availability (GA) release. If you currently have a preview version of SSMS 20 installed, it is recommended to uninstall it before installing SSMS 20.2. Keep in mind that installing SSMS 20.2 will not upgrade or replace SSMS 19.x or any older versions.

By using SQL Server Management Studio, you agree to its [license terms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/Legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms/) and [privacy policy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacy/privacystatement). For feedback, suggestions, or issue reporting, the best way to contact the SSMS team is through the SSMS Developer Community site.

SSMS 20.x does not overwrite or replace SSMS 19.x or previous versions. Instead, it installs alongside them, allowing you to use multiple versions concurrently. However, if a prior preview version of SSMS 20 is present on your system, you should uninstall it before proceeding with the installation of the latest stable release. To verify your version, open the **Help** > **About** window.
